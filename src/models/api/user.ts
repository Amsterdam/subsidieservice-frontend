/*
 * Subsidy Service API
 * Manage and allocate subsidies for real-time expense management.   Throughout this documentation, *bank profile* will refer to a collection of bank accounts owned by the same entity, while *bank account* will refer to one specific account (i.e. having a single IBAN). Access to a bank profile from the subsidy service must be arranged with the service administrator. Similarly, a *subsidy* will refer to a specific allocation of funds into one account accessible by one citizen. A group of subsidies that are all for the same purpose should come from the same dedicated master-account.   Currently, profiles at the following banks are supported:   * Bunq    The bank information returned by `GET` calls is cached in the database. It is held as up to date as possible, but due to the caching it is not absolutely real-time. The information is updated as quickly as allowed by the bank APIs.   We are using the `deprecated` tag to mark endpoints that are planned but not yet implemented, these will return a 501.   NOTA BENE: This definition is best edited in the Swagger web editor and saved in the project root, but we also store the internal working copy in the project, that is found in the autogenerated server zip and must be also downloaded; see the README.
